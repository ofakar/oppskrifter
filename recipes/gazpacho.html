## Gazpacho

### Ingredienser

- 6 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped
- 1 cucumber, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 small red onion, roughly chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups (475 ml) tomato juice or cold water
- 2 cups (140g) stale white bread, crusts removed and torn into small pieces
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp (30 ml) sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional garnishes: diced cucumber, bell pepper, onion, hard-boiled egg, and croutons

### Instruksjoner

1. Soak the stale bread in the tomato juice or cold water for about 10 minutes, or until it's softened.
2. In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes, bell pepper, cucumber, onion, and garlic. Blend until smooth.
3. Add the soaked bread and blend again until smooth.
4. While the blender is running, gradually pour in the olive oil, followed by the sherry vinegar. Blend until the soup has a smooth, creamy texture.
5. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
6. Transfer the gazpacho to a large bowl or container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until well chilled.
7. Serve the gazpacho cold, with optional garnishes on the side or sprinkled on top.

Note: You can adjust the consistency of the gazpacho to your liking by adding more tomato juice or water. For a smoother soup, you can also pass it through a fine mesh strainer after blending to remove any remaining solids. Enjoy!

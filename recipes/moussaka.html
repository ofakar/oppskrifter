### Instruksjoner

1.  Prepare the eggplant: Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and set them in a colander to drain for 30 minutes. Rinse the slices under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. In a large skillet, heat olive oil and fry the eggplant slices in batches until golden brown on both sides. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.
2.  Make the meat sauce: In a large saucepan, heat 30ml olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.
3.  Stir in the red wine, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Stir in the chopped parsley and set aside.
4.  Make the béchamel sauce: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the warmed milk and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
5.  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly whisk in about 240ml of the warm béchamel sauce to temper the egg yolks. Pour the tempered egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining béchamel sauce, whisking constantly. Stir in 115g of the grated cheese.
6.  Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease a 23x33 cm baking dish.
7.  Assemble the moussaka: Place a layer of eggplant slices in the bottom of the prepared dish. Spread half of the meat sauce over the eggplant. Add another layer of eggplant slices, followed by the remaining meat sauce. Top with a final layer of eggplant slices.
8.  Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top layer of eggplant. Sprinkle the remaining 60g of grated cheese over the béchamel.
9.  Bake the moussaka for 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.

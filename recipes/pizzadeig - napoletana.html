## Pizzadeig - Napoletana

### Ingredienser

- 500 grams (about 4 cups) Italian Tipo "00" flour or all-purpose flour
- 325 grams (about 1⅓ cups) water, room temperature
- 10 grams (about 2 tsp) fine sea salt
- 3 grams (about 1 tsp) active dry yeast or 7 grams (about 0.25 oz) fresh yeast

### Instruksjoner

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and yeast. If using active dry yeast, mix it into the flour. If using fresh yeast, dissolve it in the water first.
2. Gradually add the water to the flour mixture, mixing with a wooden spoon or your hands until the dough starts to come together. You may not need all the water, depending on the flour you're using.
3. Add the salt and continue mixing until a shaggy dough forms.
4. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand for about 10-15 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour as needed, but be cautious not to add too much.
5. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl, covering it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let it rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
6. Once the dough has risen, divide it into 2-4 equal pieces, depending on how large you want your pizzas to be. Shape each piece into a tight ball, and place them on a lightly floured surface, covering them with a damp cloth. Let them rest for an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour.
7. Preheat your oven to the highest setting, ideally 500°F (260°C) or higher, and place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to preheat.
8. While the oven is preheating, shape your pizza dough by gently stretching and pressing it into a thin circle, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust. Be careful not to overwork the dough or use a rolling pin, as this can cause the dough to lose its airiness.
9. Top your pizza with your desired ingredients, keeping in mind that traditional Neapolitan-style pizzas are typically topped with simple, high-quality ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and fresh basil.
10. Carefully transfer your pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet and bake for about 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
11. Remove your pizza from the oven, allow it to cool for a minute or two, and then slice and enjoy!

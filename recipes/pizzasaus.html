## Pizzasaus

### Ingredienser

- 800 grams (1 can) crushed San Marzano tomatoes or high-quality canned tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano (about 1 gram)
- 1 teaspoon dried basil (about 1 gram) (or a handful of fresh basil leaves, chopped)
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity) (about 2 grams)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (15-30 ml)

### Instruksjoner

1. In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until it's fragrant and lightly golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
2. Add the crushed tomatoes to the saucepan, followed by the dried oregano, dried basil, sugar (if using), salt, and black pepper. If using fresh basil, reserve it to add at the end.
3. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken slightly and the flavors should meld together.
4. If you're using fresh basil, add it to the sauce during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
5. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding more salt, pepper, or sugar as desired.
6. Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool slightly before spreading it onto your pizza dough. Any leftover sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or frozen for up to 3 months.

This pizza sauce recipe is versatile and can be adapted to your personal taste. You can add red pepper flakes for some heat, a splash of red wine for depth, or even some grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor. Experiment and enjoy!

## Semulegrynsgrøt

### Ingredienser

- 100 g semulegryn
- 1/2 l melk
- 2 ss sukker
- 1/4 ts salt
- 1/2 ts vaniljepulver
- 1 dryss kanel
- 20-30 g honning
- Alternativt: Frukt, nøtter

### Instruksjoner

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, sugar, and salt. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
2. Slowly pour the semolina into the saucepan, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming.
3. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook the porridge, stirring frequently, for about 5-7 minutes or until it thickens to your desired consistency. The porridge will continue to thicken as it cools, so keep that in mind while cooking.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
5. Let the porridge sit for a minute or two to thicken further, then serve it warm in bowls, topped with your choice of optional toppings.

Note: If you prefer a creamier porridge, you can replace a portion of the milk with heavy cream. You can also add spices like cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavor. Enjoy!
